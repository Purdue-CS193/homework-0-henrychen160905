# Henry's First CS193 Homework

This is my website hosted on GitHub Pages.
I love CS193, CS193 is my favorite class because it is not only useful, but also interesting.

Things I love about CS193:
- It's practical and teaches me technical skills outside of IDEs.
- Arman has a cool voice and accent.
- The seats in the lecture hall in Lily 126 are extremely spacious and I have no trouble getting in and out of them when I'm groggy at 9:30 am in the morning.
- The instructors are cool and nice.
- Terminal is cool


Thank you
_Have a **nice** day_
